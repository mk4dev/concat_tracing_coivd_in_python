There are 4 notebooks, working 2 by 2 for 2 implementations :

1- Implementation One : The first I did, it consist of 2 notebooks:
- contact_tracing_simple.ipynb : Contains a simple implementation for simulation of devices of persons, that can be infected or not, or get infected by contact
- infection_server_original.ipynb : Simple implementation of the infection server.


2- Implementation One : Implementation in more classes, it consist of 2 notebooks:
- classes_contact_tracing_final.ipynb : Simple implantation with more usage of classes, and some slight modifications
- infection_server_2.ipynb : Same as the first server, but with different address
